<h1>State Template v4</h1>
          <p>The California State Template is an HTML template and sample website offered by the California Office of Technology Services (OTECH) to various other agencies and departments within the State of California. The template allows OTECH to provide California Government entities with guidelines for how their websites should be created and developed, and allows OTECH to maintain consistent branding for State websites. The State Template is offered to other State entities through a website called <a href="http://webtools.ca.gov">WebTools</a>.</p>
                     <p>As technologies evolve (for example, responsive design), OTECH performs a redesign of the State Template and offers it to State agencies and departments through WebTools. Previous versions of the State Template include the 2013 responsive design template, the 2010 fixed design template, and the 2007 fluid design template.<br>
                       <br>
          As part of the v.4 redesign of the California State Template,  OTECH is now creating a new "semantic" version of the State Template. This template uses semantically named HTML 5 tags and CSS classes to provide greater flexibility when updating the State Template in the future. The overall goal is to be able to change the look-and-feel of the State template in the future through LESS and CSS, without having to drastically change the HTML markup. This would allow State entities to update their websites with greater ease when a new version of the State Template is released, and also provides them more incentive to do so.

                     <ul>
                       <li>Re-architected to utilize industry standard frameworks:

                           <li><a class="toggle" title="Bootstrap">Bootstrap</a> – for mobile first development
                           <div class="description"><p>Bootstrap is a commonly used front-end framework created by Twitter for creating websites. It basically provides scaffolding for page layouts and various templates for forms, buttons, navigation, and other commonly used website elements. Bootstrap also provides JavaScript for certain interactive functionality (such as dynamic navigation, hover effects, etc.). It also provides features for developing responsive websites.</p>
<p>The 2014 State Template is built on top of Bootstrap to create the basic layout and look-and-feel of the State Template. Using this framework provides the scaffolding and templates that can be reused throughout the website, without having to define explicit markup and CSS for such commonly used elements. Bootstrap also utilizes LESS, allowing for the 2014 State Template to use semantically named classes that are based on Bootstrap classes. </p>

                           <li><a class="toggle" title="Less CSS">{Less}</a> – extends the CSS language
                           <div class="description"><p>LESS is a dynamic stylesheet language that gets compiled to CSS that can be consumed by browsers. Using LESS over traditional CSS provides greater flexibility as LESS provides the ability to use variables, nesting, mixins, operators, and functions. </p>
<p>For the 2014 State Template, LESS (combined with semantically named classes) is used to allow OTECH flexibility in enhancing the State Template, and also for changing the look-and-feel of future templates with greater ease over traditional CSS. </p>

For the 2014 State Template, Grunt is used for performing the following tasks: Compiling LESS files into CSS files, Combining multiple CSS or JS files into a single CSS or JS file (to reduce the number of requests made by a browser), Minification of CSS and JS files (to reduce the size of files and thus bandwidth usage).</p>
